# MDM command structs and helpers for Go

Package `mdmcommands` provides structs and helpers for working with Apple MDM commands in [Go](https://go.dev).

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/jessepeterson/mdmcommands.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jessepeterson/mdmcommands)

These structs and helpers are generated using `admgencmd` from the [admgen](https://github.com/jessepeterson/admgen) project.
